[Link to article](https://analyticsindiamag.com/6-ways-r-is-best-suited-for-big-data-analytics/)

## Summary
_The article discusses six ways in which the open-source scripting language R can be utilized for big data analytics. Since its release in 1995, R has gained popularity among data scientists worldwide due to its efficient growth and effective data handling capabilities. Tech giants like Microsoft and Google also use R for large-scale data analysis. The six ways R can be used for big data analytics are as follows:_

_1. Data Analysis: R facilitates exploratory data analysis, which involves techniques such as extracting important variables, testing underlying assumptions, and gaining insights into the dataset. R provides a variety of tools and functions for data analysis._

_2. Data Visualization: R offers built-in plotting commands for creating simple graphs. The ggplot2 package in R is known for its versatility in data visualization. It implements the grammar of graphics, allowing users to easily add, remove, or modify components in a plot at a high level of abstraction._

_3. Data Wrangling: Data wrangling involves preparing data for visualization and modeling. R provides capabilities for data transformation, including importing, tidying, and transforming data. These operations play a crucial role in data analysis projects._

_4. RHIPE: RHIPE, or R and Hadoop Integrated Programming Environment, is a software package that enables the creation of MapReduce jobs within the R environment. It utilizes the Divide and Recombine technique to perform data analytics on big data. This integration of R with Hadoop allows analysts to leverage the power and flexibility of R for specifying Maps and Reduces._

_5. ORCH: ORCH, or Oracle R Connector for Hadoop, is a collection of R packages that provide predictive analytic techniques for data stored in HDFS files. It offers interfaces to work with Hive tables, the Hadoop compute infrastructure, the local R environment, and Oracle database tables. ORCH includes various analytic algorithms, such as linear regression, neural networks, clustering, and matrix completion._

_6. RHadoop: RHadoop is an open-source collection of five R packages that enable users to manage and analyze data with Hadoop from within the R environment. It allows data scientists familiar with R to leverage the capabilities of the MapR Hadoop distribution. The packages included in RHadoop are rhdfs (connectivity to Hadoop Distributed File System), rmr2 (performing statistical analysis via Hadoop MapReduce), rhbase (connectivity to HBASE distributed database), plyrmr (performing data manipulation operations on large datasets stored on Hadoop), and ravro (reading and writing avro files)._

_Overall, R provides a powerful and versatile toolset for big data analytics, encompassing data analysis, visualization, wrangling, integration with Hadoop, and predictive analytics. It has become a go-to language for data scientists working with large datasets._
